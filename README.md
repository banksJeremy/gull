polyisp
=======

<https://github.com/jeremybanks/polyisp>

A lisp-ish language that compiles to Python, PHP or JavaScript.

The first compiler is being written in Python. I intend to have one in each output language, with a lot of common code written in polyisp itself.

The language values efficient portability over power.

The standard library will be macros mapping to different functions/constructs in different languages.
